Weather-API

Weather-API is a web application that retrieves real-time weather information using the Weatherbit API. Users are prompted to provide their own Weatherbit API key along with their country and city to receive current weather data.

## Why Provide Your Own API Key?

We utilize a developmental API key that is valid for 18 days only. To ensure long-term functionality and personal usage, users must supply their own API key from Weatherbit.

## Features

The app provides the following weather information:

- Temperature (e.g., 6.1Â°C)
- Air Quality Index (e.g., 37)
- Date and Time of Observation (e.g., 2023-12-18 19:17)
- Weather Description (e.g., Light rain)
- Wind (e.g., 4.6 km/h west)
- Humidity (e.g., 78%)
- Precipitation (e.g., 0 mm)
